      I am currently working as a Software Test Engineer for a gym membership
      management software company. I love the job for it's daily challenges,
      endless growth oppurtunites but most importantly for the people and the
      passion they bring everyday to help make the world a healthier and happier
      place. Coming from a customer service and testing background and with
      aspirations of moving into a Software Engineer role, I write my code with
      a mobile first mindset and with the end-user at the forfront of my mind.
      As an endurance athlete, I am constantly outside of my comfort
      zone which pushes me to adapt and learn and be the best version of myself everyday!
      Thank you for stopping by and please do not hesitate to reach out or
      connect with me via the various social networks available.{" "}
